# Server Ops Discipline

Keep server operations reproducible. Shared storage is the source of truth;
node-local disks are disposable caches rebuilt from packs and scripts.

## Root And Scripts

- Confirm the cluster workspace root with the user before first use. Store it in
  a local, non-git config:

```bash
server-ops-discipline/scripts/configure_root.sh /path/to/root
```

- Install reusable scripts under `${ROOT_DIR}/scripts`:

```bash
mkdir -p "${ROOT_DIR}/scripts"
cp -a server-ops-discipline/scripts/. "${ROOT_DIR}/scripts/"
chmod +x "${ROOT_DIR}/scripts/"*.sh
```

- Use `ROOT_DIR`, not project- or cluster-branded root variables. Do not commit
  concrete root paths.
- Stable interfaces:

```text
${ROOT_DIR}/scripts/run_bench.sh start|stop|status|restart [--nodes nodes.txt --node 0,1]
${ROOT_DIR}/scripts/gpu_idle_watchdog.sh start|stop|status|restart
${ROOT_DIR}/scripts/prepare_data.sh --data alfworld,webshop,tau2,appworld,mcp_server
${ROOT_DIR}/scripts/pack_data.sh --data alfworld,webshop,tau2,appworld,mcp_server
${ROOT_DIR}/scripts/build_wandb_env.sh
${ROOT_DIR}/scripts/prepare_node_runtime.sh --local-only|--all-nodes ...
${ROOT_DIR}/scripts/materialize_node_runtime.sh --envs ... --data ... --sources ...
```

Project launchers may call these scripts, but must not reimplement bench,
watchdog, node materialization, SSH fanout, or root discovery.

## State Model

- Durable: code, packs, data, models, secrets, runs, and node files live under
  `${ROOT_DIR}`.
  If a cluster puts a smaller quota on the workspace tree, keep the same public
  layout and make `${ROOT_DIR}/models` or `${ROOT_DIR}/runs` symlinks to the
  real shared-storage locations.
- Disposable: extracted envs, source mirrors, data mirrors, Ray temp state, and
  service scratch live on node-local disks such as `/tmp`.
- Do not install packages during normal training startup. Build packs first,
  then materialize them onto nodes.
- Keep generated outputs, real node IP files, secrets, packs, data, models,
  checkpoints, and run logs out of git.

Recommended layout:

```text
${ROOT_DIR}/code
${ROOT_DIR}/data
${ROOT_DIR}/models
${ROOT_DIR}/packs
${ROOT_DIR}/runs
${ROOT_DIR}/secrets
${ROOT_DIR}/scripts
${LOCAL_ENVS_DIR:-/tmp/server-ops-envs}
${LOCAL_RUNTIME_DIR:-/tmp/server-ops-runtime}
```

Known cluster roots for operator lookup:

```text
H100 ecomcommonnas:
  ROOT_DIR=/mnt/bn/ecomcommonnas/yanjingyuan
  CODE_DIR=/mnt/bn/ecomcommonnas/yanjingyuan/Code
  PACK_DIR=/mnt/bn/ecomcommonnas/yanjingyuan/packs
  SECRETS_DIR=/mnt/bn/ecomcommonnas/yanjingyuan/secrets
  NODE_FILE=/mnt/bn/ecomcommonnas/yanjingyuan/scripts/ip.txt
  MODEL_DIR=/mnt/bn/ecomcommonnas/mlf/models
  SSH_PORT=10413

A100 jixf-nas-lq:
  ROOT_DIR=/mnt/bn/jixf-nas-lq/mlf
  MODEL_DIR=/mnt/bn/jixf-nas-lq/yanjingyuan_models
  RUNS_DIR=/mnt/bn/jixf-nas-lq/yanjingyuan_runs
```

These concrete paths are handoff aids, not portable config. Confirm the active
cluster root and node file before launch. When a cluster has separate quota or
performance tiers, keep the public layout stable and place symlinks behind
`${ROOT_DIR}/models`, `${ROOT_DIR}/runs`, or other top-level names. Do not
commit concrete cluster paths in training repo configs.


## Runtime Packs

- Prefer image-provided foundation training stacks when the image is complete
  and compatible.
- If the image is not complete, use one complete conda pack per foundation
  stack. For Slime, the pack must include Slime, SGLang/vLLM/Torch dependencies
  needed by that stack, and bundled Megatron source at `src/Megatron-LM`.
- Do not materialize Megatron-LM as a standalone source mirror for Slime
  training. It is part of the Slime runtime, not a separate runtime component.
- Keep task envs separate: ALFWorld, WebShop, tau2, AppWorld, MCP servers, and
  other env dependencies get their own packs.
- Keep task data separate from env packs. Data preparation is a shared-storage
  phase: run `prepare_data.sh --data ...` to download or construct
  `${ROOT_DIR}/data/<name>`, then `pack_data.sh --data ...` to write immutable
  `${ROOT_DIR}/packs/<name>-data.tar.gz` artifacts. Node materialization never
  downloads data; it only unpacks a data pack or copies an already prepared
  `${ROOT_DIR}/data/<name>` directory.
- Data packs must contain every file an env server can need on any selected
  node. For tau2, `prepare_data.sh --data tau2` must produce both raw
  official/AReaL data and portable generated AReaL task/prompt files; training
  launch should not generate node-local tau2 task files.
- AppWorld data packs must include official datasets, base DBs, and task specs
  under `${ROOT_DIR}/data/appworld/data`. `prepare_data.sh --data appworld`
  may download through the AppWorld CLI when the AppWorld env is available, or
  copy an existing portable tree from `APPWORLD_DATA_SOURCE_DIR`.
- Private MCP server datasets may come from another NAS checkout rather than a
  public downloader. Treat that checkout as an input source only: copy the
  required JSON/JSONL task files and referenced assets into
  `${ROOT_DIR}/data/mcp_server`, pack them as `mcp_server-data.tar.gz`, and have
  training read the materialized `${AGENT_ENV_DATA_DIR}` copy. Set
  `MCP_SERVER_REQUIRED_FILES` during preparation/packing for task-family
  specific files that must exist, for example an IPR product-check task JSONL.
- Validate task data before packing and after materialization. Domain-specific
  datasets should fail fast on missing required files; for example ALFWorld
  needs paired `game.tw-pddl`/`traj_data.json` files plus `logic/alfred.pddl`
  and `logic/alfred.twl2`. Use `--validate-data-load` when bringing up a new
  cluster to run supported env load smoke tests.
- Keep optional reporting clients isolated. Build W&B with
  `${ROOT_DIR}/scripts/build_wandb_env.sh`, publish
  `${ROOT_DIR}/packs/wandb.tar.gz`, and materialize it like any other env pack.
  Training repos must not use W&B from the foundation runtime, image Python,
  system Python, or user-site packages.
- Formal training runs must enable W&B and use the materialized `wandb` pack.
  `ENABLE_WANDB=0` is acceptable only for smoke tests, launch validation, or
  other short debugging runs where missing experiment curves are intentional.
- Keep task source mirrors only when the env itself needs a checkout, for
  example WebShop. Source mirrors are not a replacement for Python runtime
  dependencies.
- `prepare_node_runtime.sh --envs ...` may materialize generic runtime packs,
  not only conda packs. Codex runtime, agent skills, persona files, and MCP
  helper packs are valid env-pack names even when they do not contain
  `bin/conda-unpack`. Materializers should run `conda-unpack` only when the
  extracted target provides it.
- Publish immutable pack artifacts to `${ROOT_DIR}/packs/<name>.tar.gz` plus
  `.sha256` and `.revision`; materialize them with `--force` when replacing a
  node-local env.
- Validate a pack before use: check hashes, run `conda-unpack` for conda packs,
  import critical modules where applicable, and run an env-specific smoke test.
- Do not run Python directly from a NAS env directory. Use node-local extracted
  packs to avoid slow small-file IO and stale absolute prefixes.

## Node And Launch

- Maintain one current node file as the IP source of truth. Launch/topology
  profiles select nodes by index.
- For multi-node GPU jobs, make the routable training network interface an
  explicit launch contract. Prefer `SOCKET_IFNAME=${MLP_SOCKET_IFNAME:-eth0}`
  or a cluster-specific override, then propagate `NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME`,
  `GLOO_SOCKET_IFNAME`, and `TP_SOCKET_IFNAME` into Ray actor runtime envs.
  Do not rely on outer-shell exports reaching Ray actors.
- After resource reset: update node file, materialize runtime/data, start
  watchdog/bench, then launch jobs.
- Preserve the difference between an unset variable and an explicitly empty
  variable in launch scripts. Use `[[ -z "${VAR+x}" ]]` before applying a
  default when empty has meaning, for example `WORKER_HOSTS=''` for a
  single-node launch. Do not use `${VAR:-default}` for these fields; it can
  silently reintroduce stale worker nodes.
- Before launching training, stop bench on selected nodes. If training fails and
  GPUs idle, watchdog should restart bench by utilization threshold.
- `bench_on_exit` must call `${ROOT_DIR}/scripts/run_bench.sh`; do not embed a
  separate keepalive implementation in training repos.
- Reset experiments by stopping only selected train/Ray/env processes. Do not
  kill unrelated user processes.
- Avoid `pkill -f <pattern>` in SSH one-liners. The pattern can match the
  remote shell command itself and kill the active SSH session before cleanup
  finishes. Prefer stopping a named tmux session, or list PIDs first with
  `pgrep -af`, filter out the current shell/grep/ssh command, then kill exact
  PIDs.
- Ark/Seed CN endpoints may be reachable from the development machine but fail
  from GPU training nodes with TLS EOF or connection timeout. Treat this as a
  network path issue, not a Python dependency or harness bug. When local access
  works, run a small OpenAI-compatible proxy on the development machine and
  expose it to the node with SSH reverse forwarding, for example:
  `ssh -N -T -R 127.0.0.1:<node_port>:127.0.0.1:<local_proxy_port> ...`.
  Validate from the node with `/health` and a minimal chat/tool-call request
  before using it in a rollout.
- For repeated large-model startup, prefer a node-local model cache. Reading
  directly from NAS is acceptable for quick smoke tests, but repeated SGLang or
  actor loads should copy to a disposable local path first. If a single-node
  cache copy is slow, use file-level parallelism such as
  `CACHE_MODEL_FILE_PARALLELISM`; this is a cache-performance knob and must not
  change training semantics.

## GPU Keepalive

- Watchdog protects idle GPUs by utilization only. It should not special-case
  Slime, Ray, tmux names, or process names.
- Bench is a replaceable keepalive workload. Starting bench must not destroy
  unrelated tmux sessions or user processes.
- Keep watchdog and bench independent of training framework state.

## Debugging Order

1. Confirm node file and selected indexes.
2. Confirm env/data/source materialization on every selected node.
3. Check service logs and train logs.
4. Check GPU utilization and memory to distinguish rollout, actor, aux, and
   keepalive behavior.
5. Check resolved configs for stale values or shell pollution.
6. Change code only after locating the owning layer.
